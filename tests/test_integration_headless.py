# test_integration_headless.py — Integration tests for headless channel correctness.
# Created: 2026-03-11
#
# Catches regressions like the permission_mode hang bug (where headless channels
# hang because tool permissions require terminal interaction) and related issues.
#
# Covers:
#   1. Server startup — FastAPI app boots and health endpoint is reachable.
#   2. Tool bridge completeness — memory tools present for ALL backends.
#   3. Channel adapter tool access — bypassPermissions always set in SDK options.
#   4. Timeout guard — tool execution completes within 5 seconds (catches hangs).
#
# Tests marked @pytest.mark.integration require a running server or real external
# deps and are skipped in CI by default. Run locally with:
#   uv run pytest tests/test_integration_headless.py -v
#   uv run pytest tests/test_integration_headless.py -v -m integration  # integration only
